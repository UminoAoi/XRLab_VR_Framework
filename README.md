# XRLab VR Framework

## About
This programming framework emerged in the course of transdisciplinary cooperation between Goethe-Institut, XR Lab of the Polish-Japansese Academy of Information Technology (XR Lab PJAIT) and Kobo Association.
It was created as a follow-up activity of the transdisciplinary hackathon on creating immersive virtual
environment that took place in R&D Center of PJAIT in November 2019 as a part of transdisciplinary cooperation 
within the research framework of Kobo Association Living Lab and its research initiative HASE (Human Aspects in Science and Engineering), 
a research labs' collaboration initiative, which brings together scientists and practitioners from leading innovative 
laboratories conducting participatory research on human-technology interaction.
 
This could not happen without the involvement of our late professor Krzysztof Marasek, who enabled the cooperation 
between the research group of our Living Lab and XR Lab and Goethe-Institut. We treat this framework as a special 
tribute to our late professor. The framework will be further developed which we think will commemorate him better 
than any kind of physical monument he deserves.
 
We would also like to thank all the students and partners involved in related research activities and events
as well as all the members of our Living Lab, those affiliated with Kobo Association who participated in this project 
and all transdisciplinary experts involved with the HASE research initiative.
